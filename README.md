# Mental Health Analysis Project
## Module 8
### This project was done in collaboration with Patrick Bacza, Jay Laxami, and Stephen Mims

# Proposal

The field we are interested in working with is mental health in the tech/non-tech field. Mental health is something that effects everyone's lives and it would be impactful to find insights to helps us better understand it. The data we would be working with is a survey about attitudes towards mental health in tech companies provided by Kaggle.com.

We will clean the data and will perform all the analysis including statistical analysis for data sets. [data_cleaning.ipynb]

As a collaborative effort, we all examined different facets of the dataset and answered our own questions, creating visualizations as appropriate

While this subject could be studied indefinitely, we decided the following questions to be the best topics for the project:

- Are employers doing enough to address their employees' mental health disorders?
  Employers in the tech industry are not doing enough to address their employees’ mental health. Most are not even making formal acknowledgments or offering proper services. This could be trend outside of the tech industry as well.
  
- Are employers properly handling employee mental health/mental health data?
  Employers are not properly handling mental health issues of their employees. Employees witnessing colleagues coming forward with their mental health problems are less likely to discuss their mental health struggles than before.

- Do work conditions such as company size, remote work, and job type reflect on the number of those with mental health disorders?
  People working in the tech industry have more cases of mental health disorders than those working in non-tech. And over 70% of those afflicted are working remotely.

- If you have a mental health condition, how much does it interfere with your work?
  Mental health disorders greatly affect workplace performance. Roughly 80% of those with a condition claim their work is impacted. Any company should see mental health as a priority for their employees and their company’s wellbeing.

These are the main takeways we found based on the survey data, each file will go into further detail in their respective markdown tabs.
